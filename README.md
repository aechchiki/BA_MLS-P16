# sheet1.py: populate and intersect arrays

* Part 1: populate arrays
	- Task 1: populate preallocated array with random values
	- Task 2: populate non-preallocated array with random values 
		- Task 2.1: write nested for loop
		- Task 2.2: use uinbuilt append 
	- Task 3: check runtime of the tested methods 


* Part 2: intersect arrays
	- Task 1: naive nested for loop
	- Task 2: while loop on sorted arrays 
	- Task 3: hash function
	- Task 4: check runtime of the tested methods

# sheet2.py: binary search and exact sequence matching 

* Part 1: search arrays
	- Task 1: naive loop
	- Task 2: binary search
	- Task 3: check runtime of the tested methods
