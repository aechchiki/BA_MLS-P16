# sheet1.py: populate and intersect arrays

* Part 1: populate arrays
	- Task 1: populate preallocated array with random values
	- Task 2: populate non-preallocated array with random values 
		- Task 2.1: write nested for loop
		- Task 2.2: use uinbuilt append 
	- Task 3: check runtime of the tested methods 


* Part 2: intersect arrays
	- Task 1: naive nested for loop
	- Task 2: while loop on sorted arrays 
	- Task 3: hash function
	- Task 4: check runtime of the tested methods

# sheet2.py: binary search and exact sequence matching 

* Part 1: search arrays
	- Task 1: naive loop
	- Task 2: binary search
	- Task 3: check runtime of the tested methods

* Part 2: exact sequence matching 
	- Task 1: convert a word into a position in the array
	- Task 2: count and save the occurences of words
	- Task 3: obtain the fractal images out of sequence matching
	- Task 4: generate all possible permutations using a recursion
	
# sheet3.py: dynamic programming

* Part 1: Needleman–Wunsch
	- Task 1: implement Needleman–Wunsch
	- Task 2: test the implementation
* Part 2: permutation test and Gumble distribution
	- Task 1: randomly shuffle a string
	- Task 2: generate a reference score and calculate the score for 1000 randomly shuffled sequences
	- Task 3: plot a histogram of the calculated permutation scores
	- Task 4: compute the associate p-value for the reference score
	- Task 5: compute the associate p-value using an estimated gumble distribution
	- Task 6: plot the histogram and the fitted probability density function
